# Motivation

Have you ever being placing closure into [`Box<dyn Fn(...)>`] and wondered:
"Is there a crate to avoid heap allocations for small closures?"

Wonder no more, this is the crate.

# How to use

This crate provides declarative macro [`tiny_fn!`] to generates closure wrappers
able store closure erasing its type.

Generated closure wrappers avoid heap allocations when wrapped closure fits inline storage.

The macro is designed to be easy to write with simple syntax that mostly reuse constructs already existing in Rust.\
Behavior of generated wrappers should be obvious from the first glance.

# Example

```rust
tiny_fn! {
    struct Foo = Fn(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32;
}

let foo: Foo = Foo::new(|a, b| a + b);
assert_eq!(foo.call(1, 2), 3);
```

Macro expands to `struct Foo` definition with two public methods.

* `Foo::new` accepts any value that implements [`Fn(i32, i32) -> i32`] and returns new instance of `Foo`.
* `Foo::call` follows signature specified to the macro. e.g. `Foo::call` accepts `a: i32` and `b: i32` and returns [`i32`].\
  Plainly `Foo::call` calls closure from which this instance of `Foo` was crated using `a` and `b` arguments at the same positions.

[`tiny_fn!`] macro supports defining multiple items at once.

```rust
tiny_fn! {
    struct Foo = Fn(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32;
    struct Bar = Fn() -> String;
}

let foo: Foo = Foo::new(|a, b| a + b);
let bar: Bar = Bar::new(|| "Hello, World!".to_string());

assert_eq!(foo.call(1, 2), 3);
assert_eq!(bar.call(), "Hello, World!");
```

# Visibility

[`tiny_fn!`] macro supports visibility qualifiers.

```rust
tiny_fn! {
    pub struct Foo = Fn(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32;
    struct Bar = Fn() -> String;
    pub(crate) struct Baz = Fn();
}
```

# Attributes

[`tiny_fn!`] macro supports item attributes, including documentation.

```rust
tiny_fn! {
    /// This is `Foo` wrapper for that takes two `i32`s and return `i32`.
    pub struct Foo = Fn(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32;
}
```

# [`Fn*`] traits family

[`tiny_fn!`] macro can generate closure wrappers for any of the [`Fn*`] traits family.

```rust
tiny_fn! {
    struct A = Fn();
    struct B = FnMut();
    struct C = FnOnce();
}

let a = 42;
let a: A = A::new(|| println!("{}", a));
a.call();
a.call();

let mut b = 42;
let mut b: B = B::new(|| b += 1);
b.call();
b.call();

let c = String::from("Hello, World!");
let c: C = C::new(move || println!("{}", c));
c.call();
// c.call(); // This will not compile, because `C` can be called only once.
```

* `A` can wrap only closures that are callable when immutably borrowed. And so `A::call` takes `&self`.
* `B` can wrap only closures that are callable when borrowed. And so `B::call` takes `&mut self`.
* `C` can wrap any closures, even ones that are callable once. And so `C::call` takes `self`.

# Generics

Closure wrappers can be declared generic over number of types and those types should be used in function signature.

```rust
tiny_fn! {
    struct BinOp<T> = Fn(a: T, b: T) -> T;
}

let add: BinOp<i32> = BinOp::new(|a, b| a + b);
let mul: BinOp<i32> = BinOp::new(|a, b| a * b);

assert_eq!(mul.call(add.call(1, 2), 3), 9);
```

Here `BinOp` is generic over `T`.\
`BiOp::<T>::new` accepts closures bounds by [`Fn(T, T) -> T`].

Notably `T` is not constrained by traits in `BinOp`.\
Closure wrappers only move arguments and return values, so they don't need to know anything else about the type.

# Markers

Closure wrappers can be declared with marker traits.
Simply add `|` and list of `+` prefixed marker traits after function signature.
In Fn traits family `|` symbol is not used, but here it is required due to declarative macro limitations.

They will be added to bounds on contained types.
And if autotraits, they will be implemented for the wrapper type as well.

```rust
tiny_fn! {
    struct Foo = Fn(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 | + Send;
}

let foo: Foo = Foo::new(|a, b| a + b);

std::thread::spawn(move || {
  foo.call();
});
```

# Special generic parameters

Closure wrapper generated by [`tiny_fn!`] macro always have two generic parameters besides generic types specified by macro caller:
* Lifetime `'closure`.\
  Wrapper contains closures bound by `'closure` lifetime.
* Constant `INLINE_SIZE: usize`.\
  Closures with size up to `INLINE_SIZE` and alignment requirement not exceeding [`tiny_fn::ALIGN`] will be inlined into wrapper structure directly.\
  Otherwise heap allocation will occur.\
  `INLINE_SIZE` parameter is defaulted to [`tiny_fn::DEFAULT_INLINE_SIZE`].
